	TWO ROADS DIVERGED IN A YELLOW WOOD
	AND SORRY I COULD NOT TRAVEL BOTH
	AND BE ONE TRAVELER LONG I STOOD
	AND LOOKED DOWN ONE AS FAR AS I COULD
	TO WHERE IT BENT IN THE UNDERGROWTH
	THEN TOOK THE OTHER AS JUST AS FAIR
	AND HAVING PERHAPS THE BETTER CLAIM
	BECAUSE IT WAS GRASSY AND WANTED WEAR
	THOUGH AS FOR THAT THE PASSING THERE
	HAD WORN THEM REALLY ABOUT THE SAME
	AND BOTH THAT MORNING EQUALLY LAY
	IN LEAVES NO STEP HAD TRODDEN BLACK
	OH I KEPT THE FIRST FOR ANOTHER DAY
	YET KNOWING HOW WAY LEADS ON TO WAY
	I DOUBTED IF I SHOULD EVER COME BACK
	I SHALL BE TELLING THIS WITH A SIGH
	SOMEWHERE AGES AND AGES HENCE
	TWO ROADS DIVERGED IN A WOOD AND I
	I TOOK THE ONE LESS TRAVELED BY
	AND THAT HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE
